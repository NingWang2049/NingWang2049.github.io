Here is **Ning Wang (王宁)**.

I am a third-year Ph.D student at Xidian university. My research interests lie in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Computer Vision**, and **Machine Learning**. In particular, I am interested in the field of **Human Activity Recognition**, **Human-Object Intraction Recognition** and **Explanation AI**.
